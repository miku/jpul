CHANGELOG
---------

2011-04-25

    - finished read-only API (version 0.1.0), 
        documentation available under
        http://wwwdup.uni-leipzig.de/jobportal/api
    - added small PDf icon as download shortcut to the main
        overview page
    - fixed email regex bug
    - fixed job offer attachment filename, now conforms to CC file naming
        conventions: YYYY_MM_DD_OfferID_CompanyName_JobTitle_JobLocation.pdf
    - fixed routing, so the attachments are really ending in ".pdf" - 
        was at least an issue with wget and the like, e.g.
        http://wwwdup.uni-leipzig.de/jobportal/job/download/1000.pdf
