Directories
-----------

apache/
	Apache conf for local development, adjust at your discretion.

assets/
	Belongs to Yii.
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1679151/whats-the-proper-way-to-work-with-assets-in-yii

benchmarks/
	Untracked. Just some `ab` stats.
	
css/
	Used by Yii.
	All css.

docs/ 
	Documentation and assets. Not Yii-related.

dumps/
	Our developer DB dumps. Not Yii-related.

ext/
	External pages for testing and show-casing. Not Yii-related.
	Includes some helper scripts now, mainly: `jobportal-mount`, which 
	establishes a ssh-in-ssh connection through transparent sockets.

images/
	Used by Yii.
	
js/
	Used by Yii.

migrations/
	DB migrations. Filename format: XXX-short-description.sql
	These migrations are the means of DB updates. SQL should not
	be applied manually on the DB, but with a specified migration. 
	This way, all changes are documented. Each migration must end
	with an INSERT into the schema_version table. E.g.

		INSERT INTO schema_version(`migration_code`, `extra_notes`) 
			VALUES ('010', 'cleanup test jobs');
	
	If one has to rebuild a DB-schema from scratch, `cat` all migrations
	in one big SQL, which is ready for import. 

protected/
	All Yii. protected/data holds our current SQL schemes.

themes/
	Used by Yii, but not used by us.

uploads/
	Our generic upload folder. Used by Yii. 
	protected/components/Controller.php provides a method for 
	retrieving the path: ``string getUploadPath()``
	



Rolling out new code
--------------------

OS X
....
	
	Log in to wwwdup.uni-leipzig.de (via MacFuse / MacFusion)
	The script ext/jobportal-mount can be used  
	(just adjust your TARGET directory). There is a short story
	in that script, too, about how use an ssh proxy for ssh itself.

		$ cd /Volumes/jobp--wwwdup.uni-leipzig.de
		$ # or whatever TARGET~

	Create a dump. Always.
	
		$ zip -r webdir.`epoch`.zip webdir/  
		$ cp webdir.1296641156.zip ~/projects/jobportal-uni-leipzig/dumps
	
	Create a full dump of the MySQL DB (via phpmysql) - 
		with COMPATIBILITY MODE = NONE.
	
	Now check, if there are any outstanding DB migrations (take a look at
	the schema_version column).
	
	Is the site still up? Good. 
	
	Now pull the source directly into webdir, so ...
	
		$ cd /Volumes/jobp--wwwdup.uni-leipzig.de/webdir
		$ git st
	
	Deal with any outstanding live changes or untracked file.
	
		$ git pull origin master
	
	================
	
	Using patches to updates.
	
	sshfs is flaky on pulls with more than only a few commits (why?). To
	counteract this, you can update production via patches.
	
	Create a patch on your development machine. The last commit on production
	should be the starting point. 
	
		$ git format-patch --stdout 6f74cc68..$(cat .git/refs/heads/master) > update.patch
	
	Copy the patch to your TARGET. Check the patch:
	
		$ git apply --check update.check
	
	If everything is fine, apply: 
	
		$ git apply update.check


	
Temporarily disabling the application
-------------------------------------

Rename index.php to something else, e.g. index.php.offline; 
index.html will be dislaying a placeholder nice image instead.

Nice URLs?
