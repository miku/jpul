<p>
This is a short braindump, while I was near the code. 
I'm not sure if I forget everything after six months.
</p>

<p>
We choose Yii as the framework. We looked at Symfony,
but we didn't liked it very much: The documenation
was kind of verbose, yet leaving questions. The
somehow useful - but then again too intruding split between
frontend and backend, and mostly the too nested 
directory structure turned us off. We like yaml, but 
there were too many things, we didn't understand. 
We looked at microframeworks briefly, also later in the
process, but gluephp looked a little too bare.	
</p>

<p>
So Yii. What we basically wanted was a request abstraction,
some reasonable routing, maybe an auth component, form validation
with CSRF protection built-in and some active record cake
over the database.
</p>

<p>
Yii comes with all that. It also does not force one into the
frontend/backend decision, even though we have an "AdminController"
which serves as our backend interface. Basically a Yii app starts
in a short 40 line long "index.html" which mainly loads some configuration.
We have a few of configurations now, a sqlite3 and mysql development version
and a production version. Now this is the only sensitive part
of the app, so it's excluded from VC. DB connection, routing, filters,
logging, language are defined there.
"index.html" finally "runs" the application, which means it finds
a route, calls the appropriate controller, if allowed, and continues
to the template. Simple. 
</p>

<p>
Yii has built-in support for auth, but we don't use it - at least not fully, 
we do take advantage of WebUser and UserIDentity components, even tough the
remain pretty default. We only have one
explicit user, which is admin. So all we do is check before each request,
if the user has the role "admin". In "Controller", the base class of all our
specific controllers, there is a simple function "filterAdminOnly", which
will raise 404, if the view is protected and the user isn't admin. 403 Forbidden
would be more appropriate, but this way, we can mask the existence 
of any "admin" interface. 
</p>

<p>
We have a manageable set of controllers: Admin, Api, Job, List, Site, Stats, Ukey.
</p>

<p>Admin takes care of the task for our admin user: Creating jobs, Publish user-generated
	offers. That's basically it
</p>

<p>Api is not yet there as I write this, but it will be a full-blown RO-API
	which will enable us to script againts the database. I'm thinking of
	some standalone statistics scripts, which generate some data, metadata
	or aggregated information about the kind of content the site offers. 
	This is the part I like most. We have an early incarnation of this
	via /docs/embed.html, basically our "homepage" view "job/index" 
	accepts a parameter, "v", indicating the kind of interface, which
	is expected by the client: browser, embed or json. 
	Data and parameters stay the same, json just looks much nicer.
	A short script for a command line jobboard client was fun to write,
	even though the fun only lasted a few hours or less. Api should 
	be focussed on the machine-machine stuff. 
</p>

<p>
Job controller is takes draft, makes listings, makes queries, views jobs
or downloads attachments. 
</p>

<p>List is stats, as far as we get without queueing and cron. Just list some
	stuff, cities, companies, for the moment.
</p>

<p>Site just provides us with a login view and a sitemap for google, which
	get generated on each request - if has a special route, directly to /sitemap.xml
	as it is custom.
</p>

<p>Stats is our non-evil asnyc tracking. Viewing the stats is horrendously
	slow, since we tackle all the almost 100K rows in our tracking table, 
	but we will introduce something if it gets unbearable (namely a 
	key-value cache in the DB)</p>

<p>
Now Ukey is the last to the party. If manages the heavily stripped down
admin for the employer, without logins and password but with UUIDs, which 
aren't built in PHP we learned, so we offer them as part of our "helpers/Util"
agglutination.
</p>

<p>
We use jquery, but not the one shipped with Yii, but our own. And for that
we need to explicitly disable the asset, which happens in layouts/v2/main.php.
</p>

<p>Oh yes, layouts: We missed template inheritance in the beginning. 
Yii comes with a layout, which has a drop-in point where the rendered
view gets placed. Just that one. But fortunately, it provides a 
renderPartial function, which mitigates the missing TI. The layout
we use is actually under v2 because we had a quite large version jump
in the early life of the portal, were we just completely redesigned the
view. This was v2. Now this still lives on in /css and /images as well.
It not nice, and it will be changed, when the time comes, so maybe never.
</p>

<p>
Now how do we deal with the models?
