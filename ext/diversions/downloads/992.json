However, the market integration of\r\nalternative biomass pellets is still blocked by various constraints.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore the target of the project \u201cMixBioPells\u201d is\r\nto identify the constraints and drivers in detail and to find promising market\r\nintroduction concepts for enhancing the market relevance of alternative pellets\r\nin Europe. Since kind and potential of the\r\navailable raw materials and the local frameworks differ significantly between\r\nthe European countries and even between the regions of one country, seven\r\nproject partners will concentrate on one region in his country to analyze the\r\nlocal situation. This will be done in close cooperation with an industry\r\npartner. Based on the experiences of the local networking activities, national\r\nand international basic conditions were summarized by surveying literature\r\nstudies and ongoing research projects and interviewing relevant key actors\r\namongst the pellet supply chain. Thus the MixBioPells project provides\r\nup-to-date market information for alternative biomass pellets based on\r\ncomprehensive data collection all over Europe.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tasks<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task of the project assistant is to support\r\nseveral work within the project progress.
