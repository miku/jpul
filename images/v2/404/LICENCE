Clipart ETC License

Clipart ETC is copyright Â© 2010 by the University of South Florida.

Educational Use. A maximum of fifty (50) clipart items may be used in any
non-commercial, educational project (report, presentation, display, website,
etc.) without special permission. The use of more than fifty clipart items in
a single project requires written permission from the Florida Center for
Instructional Technology (FCIT) at USF.

PLEASE NOTE: We have been receiving more commercial requests lately than staff
can possibly respond to each day. We respond to as many as we can, but many go
unanswered. Please do not assume that you will be able to receive commercial
permission for your project, especially if you are on a deadline. It is our
intention to implement a simple credit card system for commercial use, but
that is not yet in place.

Credit. Please credit FCIT whenever a resource is used. If resources from this
site are incorporated into a website, a link to http://etc.usf.edu/clipart

Restrictions. No commercial use may be made of the clipart on this site
without written permission of FCIT. Clipart from this site may not be used to
create obscene or scandalous works. Clipart of individuals or businesses may
not be used to suggest endorsements of products, services, or activities.
