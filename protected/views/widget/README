    get.php
        The original delivery script. Used CORS (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
        to allow cross domain requests (in particular this method
        uses a Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header) - since it does not
        seem to work with IE, this script is no longer in use, except for
        some legacy clients. This script returns the complete HTML, incl
        style etc. 
    
    getJSON.php
        Returns plain JSON.
    
    getJSONP.php
        Returns json wrapped in a callback.
    
    index.php
        Widget How-To.
        
    index.php.defunkt
        To-Be-Removed.
